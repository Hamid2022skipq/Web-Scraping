US Geothermal,Energy,"ID, USA",11-50,"Geothermal energy (geo meaning ""earth"" and thermal meaning ""heat"") is energy recovered from the heat of the earth's interior. Geothermal heat can appear in the form of volcanoes, hot springs and geysers. The high temperatures in the earth's interior are a result of heat trapped during the formation of the planet, as well as the decay of naturally occurring radioactive elements. Temperatures below the surface can reach 4,200Â° C, decreasing to 650 - 1200Â° at depths of 80km-100km. Through the deep circulation of groundwater and the intrusion of molten magma into the earth's crust at depths of only 1km-5km, the heat is brought closer to the earth's surface. The molten rock then heats the surrounding groundwater, which is forced to the surface in certain areas in the form of steam or hot water (i.e. hot springs, geysers). The heat energy close to or at the earth's surface can be utilized as a source of energy."

Trevi Systems,Energy,"Petaluma, CA, USA",11-50,"Trevi Systems is a progressive energy efficient Forward Osmosis (FO) desalination company.

Trevi System's has developed an innovative and highly efficient Forward Osmosis (FO) process, in order to produce clean water from saltwater, brackish water, or industrial wastewater at a much lower cost and energy use as compared to Reverse Osmosis (RO) technologies. Rather than force water through a membrane as in RO systems, FO relies on osmotic pressure to draw water across the membrane. In the FO system, the “feed” solution or contaminated water is pumped to one side of the semi-permeable membrane. The “draw” solution, which has a high concentration of a specially designed chemical and a low concentration of water relative to the feed solution, is pumped to the other side of the membrane. The water molecules are attracted or pulled through the membrane via osmotic pressure – that is, the water molecules want to migrate from an area of high water concentration to one of low water concentration. Accordingly, water is pulled through the membrane using no energy, leaving the salts or other contaminates on the opposite side.

The benefits of the Trevi FO system are numerous:

•The system requires only a small fraction, of the electrical energy of current RO systems.

•The system uses relatively low cost waste heat or low temperature heat to separate the draw chemical from the clean water.

•The system can be customized to work under specific water conditions such as seawater, brackish water, municipal wastewater, or industrial wastewater.

•When used for desalination, the system can also be customized to produce brine streams of varying salt concentrations depending on the environmental requirements of the location.

•The system operates at ambient pressure, avoiding the extra costs of the high pressure stainless steel plumbing required by RO systems, and the need for expensive high pressure pumps."

Permaculture Institute/Buena Vista Park Foundation,Research & Education,"San Francisco, CA, USA",251-500,"Permaculture is the harmonious integration of landscape and people. Permaculture, being bounded by the ethics of care of people, care of earth and reinvestment of surplus, can provide food, energy, shelter, and other material and non-material needs in a sustainable way. The specific purpose of the SF Permaculture Guild is to support a local community of those interested in permaculture by producing educational and social events, enabling permaculture projects and providing opportunities to exchange information related to permaculture design.

History:
The San Francisco Permaculture Guild (SFPG) was started in the late 1990s as a series of informal gatherings of individuals who have studied permaculture, or who are looking for more information about this system of design and resources for putting to practical use in San Francisco.  A listserve was started sometime around 2001 for faciliating  communication amongst permaculture designers and enthusiasts in San Francisco.  In the summer of 2006, the first Permaculture Design Certificate Course taught in San Francisco was facilitated at the SF Botanical Garden.  There were more than 30 students in this class taught by Kat Steele, Kevin Bayuk and Fred Bové along with a number of guest presenters.  Among those was Geoff Lawton, a respected world-renown permaculture teacher with many years of experience in community organizing.  His advice to the class was to meet regularly, and form a more formal association for the advancement of community knowledge and skills.  From this advice grew a more concerted effort to initiate regular SFPG meetings, first, held in the same classrooms at the SF Botanical Garden where the first SF permaculture classes were offered.  These informal meetings grew in size and changed venues to accommodate the number and diversity of the attendees.In the years since the Guild has been meeting, several themes have emerged in response to community need:

continuing education
sharing of resources
networking
creating opportunities and projects at the community level.
To that end, the SF Permaculture Guild decided to form an informal governance council, to sustain the original vision of the organization and plan the path forward.    In 2010, the Guild decided officially incorporate in the state of California as a for public benefit corporation (a 501c3 organization) to respond to the needs of its constituents (i.e., enble the raising for funds and capacity through donations to be distributed to the community in service of the  mission of the organization).

What do we do:
The San Francisco Permacutlure Guild engages in or plans to engage in (at least)  the following activities:

Produce regular meetings and events to provide opportunities for participants in the guild to connect and share ideas and resources.
Facilitate the initiation of and incubate new permaculture projects in San Francisco.
Solicit ideas and resources for new permaculture projects in San Francisco.
Connect new permaculture design projects in San Francisco with resources, including volunteers and funding.
Maintain a website for collection of information about existing and potential permaculture projects in San Francisco.
Maintain an email listserve for the dissemination of information and discussion about permaculture in San Francisco."

Oscilla Power,Energy,"Seattle, WA, USA",11-50,"MULTI-MODE ENERGY CAPTURE
Triton is a highly efficient multi-mode point absorber that consists of a catenary moored surface float connected to an optimally-shaped, vertically asymmetric heave plate by three taut, flexible tethers. Unlike most conventional WECs, Triton’s surface float is excited by ocean waves in multiple modes – heave, pitch, surge and roll – allowing for increased energy capture across a wide range of ocean conditions enabling a substantially lower levelized cost of electricity.
Triton’s projected performance is based on extensive numerical modeling validated by tank testing at 1:50 scale. Testing of a 1:20 scale model is planned for Q3 2016.

HIGH EFFICIENCY ENERGY CAPTURE & CONVERSION
Triton’s drivetrain uses a variable linear hydraulic gearbox to amplify and transfer loads from the tethers to the generators. The gearbox is a high reliability hydrostatic system similar to that used in hydraulic presses. It delivers the benefits of a conventional rotary gearbox without complex moving parts. Specifically, it also allows for optimum matching of the wave-generated forces to the generator input forces, so that the generators operate at maximum efficiency while allowing the appropriate system compliance for coupling with the input wave.
Every WEC has an optimal force/displacement profile for maximum mechanical energy capture and efficiency in each wave condition. Triton’s linear gearbox design allows the load amplification factor to be adjusted to optimal levels during operation based on the wave state, enabling generator displacements to be maintained at an optimum level that is largely independent of the surface float’s displacement, maximizing power transfer over a wider range of sea states than other WECs.

The linear gearbox thus makes a significant contribution to the wide power bandwidth, increased reliability, and reduced cost. It also enables various non-continuous control strategies such as latching and declutching without imposing excess loadings on the generator or marine system, which may enable the use of advanced active control algorithms to boost power in lower sea states. Optimization of the linear drivetrain, including the linear gearbox, is being funded by Wave Energy Scotland."

We patented a low cost manufacturing process already proven at the multi-ton scale.
NanoGraf’s proprietary manufacturing process is differentiated from competitors relying on expensive and complex vapor deposition-based systems. Instead, we utilize a wet chemistry process that is highly scalable and already proven in a multi ton-scale pilot manufacturing line in Japan.

Our anode materials drop in to existing electrode mixing and coating equipment, and they have been validated in large scale battery manufacturing facilities worldwide.

Our silicon-graphene anode materials enable longer lasting, faster charging batteries.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW
​
Through our experience providing professional design and permitting services, we realize that the “brick-and-mortar” system is broken and inefficient. Solar and Telecom installers face high project costs, slow turnaround times, and design bottlenecks. GreenLancer’s innovative platform provides a “plug-n-play” access point to the solar designs and permitting services that an internal resource or brick-and-mortar firm would normally provide. GreenLancer’s lean manufacturing approach has proven to reduces soft costs and streamlines the project development process.



Our inspiration for solving this problem comes from Henry Ford’s introduction of the assembly line over 100 years ago and the resulting disruption of the entire manufacturing industry. However, assembly line design isn’t limited to manufacturing. Every professional service utilized by solar energy developers and contractors has processes, which can be broken down and solved with the same systematic approach. GreenLancer.com harnesses a combination of the latest technologies with a distributed workforce to bring assembly lines into the 21st century resulting in the next generation of professional services.

Cypress Envirosystems,Materials & Manufacturing,"San Jose, CA, USA",51-100,"Our goal is to help older plants and buildings save energy and improve productivity. We specialize in technologies which can be installed with minimum disruption and expense. Our products, such as the Wireless Pneumatic Thermostat, Wireless Gauge Reader or Wireless Steam Trap Monitor, require minutes to install, cost a fraction of traditional solutions, and typically pay back within 18 months.

THE CHALLENGE

Managers at older facilities must often tolerate dated legacy technologies such as pneumatic thermostats, mechanical steam traps, and manual gauges. Compared to new state-of-the art plants or buildings, these sites typically consume more energy, require more maintenance labor, incur higher unplanned downtime, and deliver lower yield or productivity. In today’s competitive business environment, these factors put older facilities at a serious disadvantage.

Although many plant and building operators would like to upgrade their facilities with the latest automation technology, the cost of running new wires, disrupting existing occupants or production, and triggering potential safety code upgrades makes it unfeasible. As an operator of existing manufacturing plants and buildings in over a dozen sites worldwide, Cypress understands these challenges first hand."

Second Nature,Advocacy or Policy,"Raleigh, NC, USA",11-50,"Mission
Second Nature is committed to accelerating climate action in, and through, higher education.

We do this by mobilizing a diverse array of higher education institutions to act on bold climate commitments, to scale campus climate initiatives, and to create innovative climate solutions. We align, amplify, and bridge the sector’s efforts with other global leaders to advance urgent climate priorities.

Vision
We envision humanity thriving through healthy, just, and sustainable living within a dynamically changing earth system. We see higher education playing a prominent leadership role in shaping research, learning, and communities that inspire and operationalize this positive future. Second Nature serves as a critical driver for leaders in higher education that commit to this responsibility.

Strategy
From its founding, Second Nature has worked to expand higher education’s ability to solve pressing sustainability challenges. Since 2006, that focus has been aimed at addressing the largest environmental challenge that civilization has faced: global climate change. This was the launch year of the Presidents’ Climate Leadership Commitments, now the longest standing voluntary carbon reduction program in the world, and through it the Climate Leadership Network of over 600 universities and colleges formed.

Our 2019-2022 Strategic Plan focuses on the imperative for exponential growth in climate progress to work towards 50% decarbonization in the US economy by 2030 based on advice from the best available science. This three year plan focuses on supporting network performance and cross-sector activity with the core of our strategy centered around the expansion of valued climate services.

We will continue activating more schools as climate leaders and driving climate action with other sectors, but need “better and more of it” within this 11-year window of opportunity to act. Leveraging higher education’s innovative research and partnership strengths will be key to proactively overcome the climate emergency.

What Defines Us
We will strive to have our commitments to diversity, transparency, humility, innovation, and community be qualities that are said about us, not characteristics that we simply declare. These values serve as our mirror as well as our lens for focused decision-making, internal organizational dynamics, and engagement with external stakeholders.

Diversity
At Second Nature, we recognize the fundamental value of diversity, and the essential role it plays in building a sustainable and positive global future. We are committed to a diverse workplace in which all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, because we believe that an inclusive, supportive environment enables us to thrive, and better meet the needs of our network and the communities we serve.

To us, the term diversity recognizes and encourages social and cultural differences, as well as individual ones. Current and historical inequities create uneven access to opportunities, and we are committed to breaking down those barriers in our work. We understand diversity to be not only the absence of discriminatory behavior or opinions, but also the active support of passionate, smart, and motivated employees and partners from a variety of backgrounds and experiences.

Embracing true diversity involves hiring, engaging, and supporting people who represent many perspectives, think differently, and challenge our assumptions. Diversity is the backbone of an innovative and vibrant organization, and though pursuing it is not always easy — it is vital. We are continually learning, and striving towards growth and action that will allow us to better affirm diversity and equity in our work, and serve as a model of change for others in the field."
Terrestrial Energy,Energy,"Oakville, Ontario, Canada",11-50,"errestrial Energy is developing revolutionary — not simply evolutionary — fission technology for electric power and hydrogen and much more. To achieve this, we use completely different nuclear technology – a molten salt as coolant and fuel in our Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR®) power plant. With this technologically superior yet proven approach, IMSR® nuclear power plants are on a clear path to market and are more affordable, more cost competitive, and more versatile than conventional nuclear power plants that have been in use commercially for over 60 years.

IMSR® technology can be brought to market quickly, building them in four years to produce electricity or industrial heat at prices competitive with fossil fuels, while emitting no greenhouse gases. The first IMSR® power plants are expected to come online in the late 2020s.

IMSR® technology is today’s reliable and resilient clean energy game changer."
Oklo,Energy,"Sunnyvale, CA, USA",11-50,"The Aurora nuclear reactor, being developed by Okra, is a nuclear power reactor concept design that received a site use permit for testing in 2020 from the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The site use permit, issued in December 2019 is not an Nuclear Regulatory Commission permit. It is the ""first and only permit ever issued in the U.S. to a nuclear plant using something other than a light water (""water-cooled"") reactor"".[1] It will use ""recycled"" high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel originally fabricated for the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II),[2][3][4] and if fully operational, would become ""the first fuel-recycling commercial reactor in the United States"".[5] The DOE's Idaho National Laboratory (INL) said it would provide 10 tons of HALEU for the test reactor which corresponds to most of the available supply.[6] Reprocessing would occur at INL's Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC) and possibly also the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), neither of which are operational facilities as of early 2020.[7]

The reactor design is a fast-neutron reactor with heat pipe cooling similar to the NASA Kilopower reactor.[3] According to the designers, the reactor will have a ""large negative temperature reactivity coefficient"", lacks pumps and valves, uses heat pipes for heat removal, has no nuclear refueling intervals and associated core exposure, and its core is buried underground.[8] In presenting its safety design to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Oklo quoted a study of the EBR-II, which is a different reactor technology, as being ""inherently protected without requiring emergency power, safety systems, or operator intervention"".[8]

The Aurora is being developed by Oklo Inc.[3] Oklo Inc was founded in 2014 and is a Y Combinator company, with investors including Hydrazine Capital (founded by Sam Altman, with Peter Thiel as its sole limited partner); Facebook’s co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz; Ron Conway of SV Angels; Kevin Efrusy, a technology investor at Accel Partners; Daniel Aegerter, a Swiss investor and entrepreneur, Tim Draper of Draper Associates, Crunchfund, and several smaller investors including early employees of Google and Yahoo."

wEarthwhile,Advocacy or Policy,United States,11-50,"WearthWhile seeks to reconnect humanity back to Earth by addressing the issues facing the environment and, consequently, those in it. Work in the humanities is a real path for change because political marketing doesn’t appeal to people’s emotions the way that art and stories do. And it seems like getting people to connect to their own humanity and feelings is essential to our ability to connect and have compassion for others. We don’t want to distract, overwhelm, or create burden by adding more to social media with the endless stories surrounding the social sphere; the intention is to replace the focus back on the faces of the change. We don’t expect to approach society as what we think we want them to think, but instead what we want them to do and let them form what they should do.

Efficiency means more than lower utility bills. It increases property value, business profitability, and personal comfort and quality of life. We are passionate about bringing diverse groups of utilities, trade allies, community organizations, and consumers to the table, so that we can all collaborate to reach a common goal: making clean and sustainable resources more available, more accessible, and more affordable, for all populations.

WE TRANSFORM EFFICIENCY INTO IMPACT
With purposeful engagement of the right partners, we create synergies for massive impact. We design community-centric programs and platforms to facilitate seamless access to efficiency services, simplifying utility-to-consumer communication and coordination.
The net effect is programs that reach more people, more cost-effectively, more quickly. The transformation happens when a one-time change cascades into a lifetime of sustainable savings."

Standard : Establishes the core rules and requirements that must be met for any project, program or activity to be certified under the framework. Depending on the circumstances, our standards may set out higher-level requirements or, for more complex endeavors, include more detailed rules and procedures.
Independent Assessment : Ensures that projects, programs and activities meet our standards. Where standards require independent auditing or verification, we establish processes for accrediting auditors, overseeing their work, and sanctioning them if they underperform. We provide support and oversight to established accreditation programs to ensure cost-effective and high-quality independent auditing.
Accounting Methodologies : Allow for the determination of baselines (ie, what would have happened in the absence of the project, policy or program) and set out specific parameters for measuring, accounting and monitoring impacts.
Registry : Displays the performance of projects, programs or activities to allow tracking of results or, in some cases, tradable units. The final programmatic component of a typical standards framework and essential to functioning certification markets, registries provide tracking services to account holders and transparent project documentation to the public."

Feasible,Energy,"Berkeley, CA, USA",11-50,"Critical need: There is a major effort to develop cheaper, safer, longer-lasting batteries, and to improve the efficiency of battery usage. However, the battery industry is limited by the diagnostic tools and sensors at its disposal as there is no accurate, scalable, non-invasive way to measure the physical processes within a battery during operation. Technology vision: Our vision is to improve the way batteries are made, tested, and managed by providing the industry with low-cost, non-destructive, physical diagnostics in real time and at scale. Current state-of-the-art: Physical analysis of batteries can be carried out with x-ray, electron, or neutron sources, but these methods are expensive and are not deployable in commercial installations. On-line testing of state of charge and state of health is done mainly with electrical techniques, which may interrupt operation, deplete charge, and only provide cell-averaged, abstract information of internal features. Key innovation: The behavior of sound in a battery is sensitive to any changes in the physical properties along the path of acoustic waves. Leveraging know-how from seismology, acoustic analysis of batteries offers direct and detailed information about their internal components and physical structure, which electrical, thermal, and strain-based methods cannot. Manufacturing challenges: As we decrease the geometric footprint and cost of our system, the biggest challenge will be to maintain the repeatability and quality of measured signals. Competing technology: There is a growing effort in developing new, real-time physical diagnostic methods for batteries, but most have been limited to experimental systems. Truly in operando diagnostic methods have been limited to neutron or x-ray methods, which are not scalable, and to strain or thermal techniques, which are indirect and cell-averaged. First market hypothesis: Currently, our initial target is the battery manufacturing market to improve yield and quality control. Potential for impact: The need for better batteries is keeping many promising technologies from widespread adoption. Our goal is to develop tools that will enable the development of next-generation batteries. We're looking for: Technical collaborators Technoeconomic analysis Team members - scientists, engineers Team members - business Interns Funders Joint development partners"

Forest Trends,Advocacy or Policy,"Washington D.C., DC, USA",11-50,"The fate of our climate is intrinsically tied to the fate of our natural ecosystems. Earth’s forests soak up between 30 and 40 percent of global carbon emissions each year. Oceans absorb another quarter. In the United States, specifically, forests, grasslands, and soils already sequester more than half the amount of carbon that all cars and trucks on US roads emit.
Protecting these carbon-rich ecosystems isn’t optional; it’s a prerequisite for ensuring a habitable Earth for future generations.
We have a long way to go. Deforestation is responsible for around 15 percent of annual CO 2 emissions around the world, reducing a significant portion of forests’ carbon storage. And the broader “land use” sector, which includes agriculture, is responsible for roughly 25 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.
While the challenge of cutting those numbers is daunting, the potential climate benefits are huge. Keeping trees standing prevents emissions from their destruction while at the same time bolstering the planet’s storage capacity for carbon, making forests a uniquely powerful weapon against climate change. For example, scientists estimate that halting and reversing tropical deforestation could carry us a quarter of the way toward avoiding catastrophic global warming.Forest Trends’ work on emissions cuts across traditional boundaries to find practical, real-world solutions by bringing new allies to the table. Specifically, we:

Track progress by governments and international institutions toward financing forest protection, particularly through the UN program Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+)
Leverage new combinations of funding – public and private, domestic and international – to scale up forest conservation and “climate-smart” agriculture.
Enlist the help of the private sector , the biggest missing link in the fight against climate change – and how to pay for it .
Promote policies that put natural infrastructure to work helping vulnerable communities adapt to the intensifying effects of a changing climate."

Genecis Bioindustries,Materials & Manufacturing,Remote,11-50,"Genecis Bioindustries is a biotechnology company solving the related climate crises of organic waste and plastic pollution with one circular economy solution: PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoate) made from organic waste. PHA offers the same functionality as plastic, without the pollution. PHA is a biodegradable, compostable, and non-toxic alternative to traditional plastics.

How does it work?
PHA is a naturally occurring polymer, found in the cells of bacteria, that can be used as a non-toxic and biodegradable replacement to oil-based polymers. Other PHA producers use food-source/food-competing feedstocks like soy or canola, which have a land, water, and carbon footprint. Genecis uses existing food and agricultural wastes, lowering our environmental impact, valorizing waste streams, and dropping the cost of PHA production.
Our PHA is also customizable. PHA tends to be hard and brittle, making it challenging to produce PHA-based products that have flexible or amorphous characteristics. Genecis, however, can finetune the PHA comonomer ratio; PHA is a blend of butyrate and valerate, and by adjusting the percentage of each, the rigidity and flexibility of the PHA can be tuned. This allows Genecis to design PHA-based products with a wider range of applications, including: replacing single-use plastics, including packaging; clothing and textiles (with zero micro-plastic shedding); automotive interiors; medical tools and products, including sutures, grafts, and other equipment; and food contact applications.
PHA breaks down naturally in the environment without leaving behind harmful microplastics or toxic residue. Ideally, PHA products will be composted, but if they end up in a landfill or a waterway (as most products do, unfortunately), they will break down safely with no impact on the natural environment.
Our goal is to build a robust circular economy by turning organic waste into PHA, then composting PHA-based products at end-of-life so they can be upcycled into new products. The circular economy for PHA aims to create a closed-loop system where waste is minimized and resources are conserved, leading to a more sustainable and resilient economy."

For the majority of the modern building era, this was just chalked up as a common problem – one that contractors and homeowners just accepted.

It all started in Dr. Mark Modera’s California garage in 1993, where he invented a breakthrough aerosol-based sealing technology. For the first time ever, it was possible to seal leaks and holes in air ducts from the inside out. Up until that time, the only way to seal ductwork was messy, labor intensive, and not an option for most homeowners.
Modera’s invention was very well received amongst the industry and was even awarded the prestigious Energy Top 100 award by the US Department of Energy.
After trying to bring the technology to market through a major heating and air manufacturer, Dr. Mark Modera teamed up with Amit Gupta – a heating & air industry leader, to bring Aeroseal technology to homeowners all over the country.

To illustrate through objective facts and figures how the failure to enforce or implement environmental laws increases pollution and harms public health;
To hold federal and state agencies, as well as individual corporations, accountable for failing to enforce or comply with environmental laws; and
To help local communities obtain the protections of environmental laws.

We act as a watchdog because we have to. State and federal agencies charged with protecting the environment often are squeezed by limited resources and political interference from well-funded lobbyists hired by the industries they are required to regulate. We help level the playing field by giving communities the legal and technical resources they need to claim their rights under environmental laws.
Political influence should play no role when the government decides whether to enforce laws which keep cancer-causing benzene out of the lungs of children, for example, or deadly coal soot particles out of the bloodstreams of the elderly.
We do this by advocating for fair enforcement of environmental laws and regulations; writing and distributing reports and data; taking legal actions against big polluters and government agencies, when necessary; and by teaching communities how to participate in the public process regarding important state and federal environmental decisions."

Our purchases are based on how much carbon you’re aiming to offset. Whether you’re looking to reduce your footprint or get all the way to net zero, we can help you reach your goals quickly. And because we use existing markets, the cost is transparent, and your offset is easily verified. You’ll never be left wondering if your efforts created a real impact or not.
