For farmers who are building the quality of their soil every year, insecure land tenure critically inhibits multi-year business planning. Many talented farmers with profitable operations do not qualify for a conventional loan and/or do not have enough capital saved to make a large down payment. The primary alternative is leased land, which is often short-term, insecure and requires permission from landowners to erect basic farm infrastructure. Dirt Capital fills these gaps by facilitating farmland transitions, crafting long-term leases that allow businesses to expand securely, and providing defined pathways to ownership.\n\nFARMER PARTNERS\nWe work with sustainable farmers who have successful, existing operations, established markets and the opportunity to grow and expand their business through long-term, secure land access.\n\nMost of our land investment partnerships result from a farmer contacting Dirt Capital with one of the following scenarios:\n\nRelocate an existing farm to a larger property, or to a farm with more secure land tenure\n\nExpand a successful operation by acquiring nearby land\n\nTransfer a farm to non-family or family successors\n\nConserve when land trusts look to partner with a like-minded organization, or keep already conserved land in active agricultural production\n\nTransform a farm with infrastructure updates for the next generation\u2019s efficiency\n\nReorganize, or refinance a farm in the event of a change in the partnership or business"

Initially, the technology was applied to develop an agricultural model to analyze corn and soy production in the United States. Using imagery from various satellite constellations, weather data, and other datasets, the model accurately predicted yield six months prior to the end of the growing season.\n\nRealizing the potential for the technology applied to use cases around the globe, Descartes Labs turned its focus to developing a cloud-based supercomputing platform for the application of machine intelligence to massive data sets. This platform could be used by anyone to develop intelligent learning models to do science on data, and make that data actionable.\n\nCapitalizing on the confluence of advances in AI and high-performance cloud computing \u2013 along with the rapid increase of sensors capturing information all over the globe \u2013 Descartes Labs has created an enterprise data refinery that enables organizations to model \u2013 and predict changes in \u2013 natural resources and the entire value chains in which they live. With an initial focus on satellite imagery, Descartes Labs processes a pipeline of data flows from all the major satellite constellations, at scale, to provide instant access to analysis-ready images of the entire world via a massive, searchable, on-demand interface. For example, petabytes of imagery can be searched and retrieved, and all features from various constellations accessed, in under 100 milliseconds.\n\nBy collecting, normalizing, and presenting science-ready data generated by satellites, the Descartes Labs Platform is advancing and accelerating unique applications of machine intelligence for consumers, corporations, and governments worldwide. Descartes Labs is headquartered in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with offices in San Francisco, Los Alamos, and New York City."

Compared to new state-of-the art plants or buildings, these sites typically consume more energy, require more maintenance labor, incur higher unplanned downtime, and deliver lower yield or productivity. In today\u2019s competitive business environment, these factors put older facilities at a serious disadvantage.\n\nAlthough many plant and building operators would like to upgrade their facilities with the latest automation technology, the cost of running new wires, disrupting existing occupants or production, and triggering potential safety code upgrades makes it unfeasible.

Curb began in 2007 as RideCharge, an online service for business travelers to manage the booking and expensing of taxi rides and other local ground transportation. It soon developed a broader consumer focus, hastened by the adoption of smartphone technology.\n\nIn our second iteration, Curb was Taxi Magic, the first mobile app for ordering a ride, on-demand. After Apple introduced the App Store as a distribution platform for consumer apps, we built Taxi Magic upon our existing technology and released it in January 2009. Over the next five years, we built a nationwide network of riders, drivers, and taxi companies. In that time, our technology powered millions of rides and highlighted the challenges facing everyday travelers.\n\nIn August 2014, Taxi Magic became Curb to deliver an improved ride experience and consumer choice to ground travelers everywhere.

One such technique, Ocean Iron Fertilization (OIF), is based on a natural process that is one of the Earth's primary natural mechanisms to remove carbon dioxide. It has very high mitigation potential compared to other available methods, and also has relatively low cost.\n\nOIF works by improving the efficiency of natural phytoplankton production in the open ocean, adding to the very large natural amount of carbon sequestration that takes place in the world's oceans every year. Publicly funded research scientists have investigated aspects of the science behind the technique in twelve small-scale experimental trials since 1993, which have shown that the addition of iron can stimulate large blooms of phytoplankton. Given this promise, a number of scientists and private corporations are calling for moderate scale demonstrations to better understand the efficacy and impact of this mechanism, specifically with the intention of assessing its possible use for climate mitigation"
