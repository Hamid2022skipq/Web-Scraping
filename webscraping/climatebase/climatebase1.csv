Floodbase,Research & Education,"Brooklyn, NY, USA",11-50,"Floodbase was founded by Bessie Schwarz and Dr. Beth Tellman while studying as Masters students at Yale University. Both had experience working with climate vulnerable communities and saw firsthand how a lack of data directly contributed to inequity and financial ruin in the face of climate change. At Yale, they built the first iteration of Floodbase as a side project to fix disaster aid lists in El Salvador and New York state. Google flew them to Mountain View for a presentation on V1 of the tech and quickly funded them to build out the full research.
Since its founding, Floodbase has pioneered the field of satellite flood tracking, with our science appearing on the cover of Nature in 2021. Our Flood Intelligence Platform has enabled the United Nations and several national governments to improve flood disaster response. We are now powering a new type of flood insurance to help flood-vulnerable communities around the world access financial support and adapt in the face of increasing climate disasters."

Second Nature,Advocacy or Policy,"Raleigh, NC, USA",11-50,"Mission
Second Nature is committed to accelerating climate action in, and through, higher education.

We do this by mobilizing a diverse array of higher education institutions to act on bold climate commitments, to scale campus climate initiatives, and to create innovative climate solutions. We align, amplify, and bridge the sector’s efforts with other global leaders to advance urgent climate priorities.

Vision
We envision humanity thriving through healthy, just, and sustainable living within a dynamically changing earth system. We see higher education playing a prominent leadership role in shaping research, learning, and communities that inspire and operationalize this positive future. Second Nature serves as a critical driver for leaders in higher education that commit to this responsibility.

Strategy
From its founding, Second Nature has worked to expand higher education’s ability to solve pressing sustainability challenges. Since 2006, that focus has been aimed at addressing the largest environmental challenge that civilization has faced: global climate change. This was the launch year of the Presidents’ Climate Leadership Commitments, now the longest standing voluntary carbon reduction program in the world, and through it the Climate Leadership Network of over 600 universities and colleges formed.

Our 2019-2022 Strategic Plan focuses on the imperative for exponential growth in climate progress to work towards 50% decarbonization in the US economy by 2030 based on advice from the best available science. This three year plan focuses on supporting network performance and cross-sector activity with the core of our strategy centered around the expansion of valued climate services.

We will continue activating more schools as climate leaders and driving climate action with other sectors, but need “better and more of it” within this 11-year window of opportunity to act. Leveraging higher education’s innovative research and partnership strengths will be key to proactively overcome the climate emergency.

What Defines Us
We will strive to have our commitments to diversity, transparency, humility, innovation, and community be qualities that are said about us, not characteristics that we simply declare. These values serve as our mirror as well as our lens for focused decision-making, internal organizational dynamics, and engagement with external stakeholders.

Diversity
At Second Nature, we recognize the fundamental value of diversity, and the essential role it plays in building a sustainable and positive global future. We are committed to a diverse workplace in which all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, because we believe that an inclusive, supportive environment enables us to thrive, and better meet the needs of our network and the communities we serve.

To us, the term diversity recognizes and encourages social and cultural differences, as well as individual ones. Current and historical inequities create uneven access to opportunities, and we are committed to breaking down those barriers in our work. We understand diversity to be not only the absence of discriminatory behavior or opinions, but also the active support of passionate, smart, and motivated employees and partners from a variety of backgrounds and experiences.

Embracing true diversity involves hiring, engaging, and supporting people who represent many perspectives, think differently, and challenge our assumptions. Diversity is the backbone of an innovative and vibrant organization, and though pursuing it is not always easy — it is vital. We are continually learning, and striving towards growth and action that will allow us to better affirm diversity and equity in our work, and serve as a model of change for others in the field."

Oklo,Energy,"Sunnyvale, CA, USA",11-50,"The Aurora nuclear reactor, being developed by Okra, is a nuclear power reactor concept design that received a site use permit for testing in 2020 from the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The site use permit, issued in December 2019 is not an Nuclear Regulatory Commission permit. It is the ""first and only permit ever issued in the U.S. to a nuclear plant using something other than a light water (""water-cooled"") reactor"".[1] It will use ""recycled"" high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel originally fabricated for the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II),[2][3][4] and if fully operational, would become ""the first fuel-recycling commercial reactor in the United States"".[5] The DOE's Idaho National Laboratory (INL) said it would provide 10 tons of HALEU for the test reactor which corresponds to most of the available supply.[6] Reprocessing would occur at INL's Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC) and possibly also the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), neither of which are operational facilities as of early 2020.[7]

The reactor design is a fast-neutron reactor with heat pipe cooling similar to the NASA Kilopower reactor.[3] According to the designers, the reactor will have a ""large negative temperature reactivity coefficient"", lacks pumps and valves, uses heat pipes for heat removal, has no nuclear refueling intervals and associated core exposure, and its core is buried underground.[8] In presenting its safety design to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Oklo quoted a study of the EBR-II, which is a different reactor technology, as being ""inherently protected without requiring emergency power, safety systems, or operator intervention"".[8]

The Aurora is being developed by Oklo Inc.[3] Oklo Inc was founded in 2014 and is a Y Combinator company, with investors including Hydrazine Capital (founded by Sam Altman, with Peter Thiel as its sole limited partner); Facebook’s co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz; Ron Conway of SV Angels; Kevin Efrusy, a technology investor at Accel Partners; Daniel Aegerter, a Swiss investor and entrepreneur, Tim Draper of Draper Associates, Crunchfund, and several smaller investors including early employees of Google and Yahoo."

Our mission is to help governments, businesses, and financial institutions drive growth while addressing climate risk.

Our Focus
With international expertise in finance and policy, Climate Policy Initiative’s climate finance division helps governments, businesses, and financial institutions drive economic growth while addressing climate change. The program, which is led by Dr. Barbara Buchner, works to drive low carbon, resilient investment at scale.
Our program areas form a stepping stone approach to reaching this goal:

The State of Climate Finance – CPI is the leading authority on tracking and analyzing climate finance flows. The Global Landscape of Climate Finance is the most comprehensive inventory of climate change investment available. It is a key tool for policy makers to assess the scale of finance, identify the main actors in the market, reveal investment gaps, and highlight opportunities to mobilize finance to fulfill investment potential. Our work influenced the Paris Agreement, and continues to be used by the UNFCCC. CPI’s robust methodology has also been applied at a national and sectoral level to support the governments of India, Indonesia, and Cote d’Ivoire, as well as by SEforAll to assess progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal to improve access to energy, and by IRENA to track renewable energy investment globally.
Effective Finance – CPI advises governments and development finance institutions on the effectiveness of their portfolios, including the UK government’s Department for International Development, the Climate Investment Funds, and the Ministry of Finance in Indonesia. CPI also works to improve public finance interventions in key regions, such as India and Indonesia. For example, in India, we have worked with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Ministry of Finance to illuminate issues around the cost of capital and revise low-cost debt policies.
Transformative Finance – CPI supports the implementation of new and transformative finance solutions that mobilize sustainable investment at scale. CPI manages the Lab : a high-level group of public and private investors that identifies, develops, and supports pilots of transformative climate finance instruments. Since its start in 2014, the 26 investment vehicles incubated and launched by the Lab have collectively mobilized over $1 billion in finance for renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, water, and climate resilience projects around the world. The Lab has been endorsed by the governments of India, Brazil, and the G7. CPI’s work managing the Lab was also selected in the top 11 “Best Bets” out of nearly 2000 applicants to the MacArthur 100&Change award. In addition to the Lab, CPI manages USICEF, India’s first project preparation facility for distributed renewable energy, and leads GNI+, a partnership between CPI, Baker McKenzie, and AECOM to provide governments with the best available policy, technical, financial, governance, and legal expertise to support their climate goals."

Standard : Establishes the core rules and requirements that must be met for any project, program or activity to be certified under the framework. Depending on the circumstances, our standards may set out higher-level requirements or, for more complex endeavors, include more detailed rules and procedures.
Independent Assessment : Ensures that projects, programs and activities meet our standards. Where standards require independent auditing or verification, we establish processes for accrediting auditors, overseeing their work, and sanctioning them if they underperform. We provide support and oversight to established accreditation programs to ensure cost-effective and high-quality independent auditing.
Accounting Methodologies : Allow for the determination of baselines (ie, what would have happened in the absence of the project, policy or program) and set out specific parameters for measuring, accounting and monitoring impacts.
Registry : Displays the performance of projects, programs or activities to allow tracking of results or, in some cases, tradable units. The final programmatic component of a typical standards framework and essential to functioning certification markets, registries provide tracking services to account holders and transparent project documentation to the public."

Feasible,Energy,"Berkeley, CA, USA",11-50,"Critical need: There is a major effort to develop cheaper, safer, longer-lasting batteries, and to improve the efficiency of battery usage. However, the battery industry is limited by the diagnostic tools and sensors at its disposal as there is no accurate, scalable, non-invasive way to measure the physical processes within a battery during operation. Technology vision: Our vision is to improve the way batteries are made, tested, and managed by providing the industry with low-cost, non-destructive, physical diagnostics in real time and at scale. Current state-of-the-art: Physical analysis of batteries can be carried out with x-ray, electron, or neutron sources, but these methods are expensive and are not deployable in commercial installations. On-line testing of state of charge and state of health is done mainly with electrical techniques, which may interrupt operation, deplete charge, and only provide cell-averaged, abstract information of internal features. Key innovation: The behavior of sound in a battery is sensitive to any changes in the physical properties along the path of acoustic waves. Leveraging know-how from seismology, acoustic analysis of batteries offers direct and detailed information about their internal components and physical structure, which electrical, thermal, and strain-based methods cannot. Manufacturing challenges: As we decrease the geometric footprint and cost of our system, the biggest challenge will be to maintain the repeatability and quality of measured signals. Competing technology: There is a growing effort in developing new, real-time physical diagnostic methods for batteries, but most have been limited to experimental systems. Truly in operando diagnostic methods have been limited to neutron or x-ray methods, which are not scalable, and to strain or thermal techniques, which are indirect and cell-averaged. First market hypothesis: Currently, our initial target is the battery manufacturing market to improve yield and quality control. Potential for impact: The need for better batteries is keeping many promising technologies from widespread adoption. Our goal is to develop tools that will enable the development of next-generation batteries. We're looking for: Technical collaborators Technoeconomic analysis Team members - scientists, engineers Team members - business Interns Funders Joint development partners"

Forest Trends,Advocacy or Policy,"Washington D.C., DC, USA",11-50,"The fate of our climate is intrinsically tied to the fate of our natural ecosystems. Earth’s forests soak up between 30 and 40 percent of global carbon emissions each year. Oceans absorb another quarter. In the United States, specifically, forests, grasslands, and soils already sequester more than half the amount of carbon that all cars and trucks on US roads emit.
Protecting these carbon-rich ecosystems isn’t optional; it’s a prerequisite for ensuring a habitable Earth for future generations.
We have a long way to go. Deforestation is responsible for around 15 percent of annual CO 2 emissions around the world, reducing a significant portion of forests’ carbon storage. And the broader “land use” sector, which includes agriculture, is responsible for roughly 25 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.
While the challenge of cutting those numbers is daunting, the potential climate benefits are huge. Keeping trees standing prevents emissions from their destruction while at the same time bolstering the planet’s storage capacity for carbon, making forests a uniquely powerful weapon against climate change. For example, scientists estimate that halting and reversing tropical deforestation could carry us a quarter of the way toward avoiding catastrophic global warming.Forest Trends’ work on emissions cuts across traditional boundaries to find practical, real-world solutions by bringing new allies to the table. Specifically, we:

Track progress by governments and international institutions toward financing forest protection, particularly through the UN program Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+)
Leverage new combinations of funding – public and private, domestic and international – to scale up forest conservation and “climate-smart” agriculture.
Enlist the help of the private sector , the biggest missing link in the fight against climate change – and how to pay for it .
Promote policies that put natural infrastructure to work helping vulnerable communities adapt to the intensifying effects of a changing climate."

To accelerate the world’s transition to carbon negativity so we can all continue enjoying the things we love on a healthy, thriving planet. A scrappy initial prototype attracted the attention of neighbors, and eventually the San Francisco Bomb Squad – and Noya was born.
Initial R&D focused on retrofitting cooling towers for Direct Air Capture. We gathered more data while assembling an amazing, committed team of scientists, engineers, and operators.
With the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 passing into law, there's now an unparalleled opportunity for Direct Air Capture companies who capture 1,000+ tons of CO 2 per deployment. A worthy challenge. And Noya has committed to moving forward with these projects first to quickly scale up to achieve this.

How much carbon can be stored that way and for how long? What are the co-benefits and negative consequences of these efforts? How will they affect other parts of the natural environment and the communities of people living in the affected areas?

Genecis Bioindustries,Materials & Manufacturing,Remote,11-50,"Genecis Bioindustries is a biotechnology company solving the related climate crises of organic waste and plastic pollution with one circular economy solution: PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoate) made from organic waste. PHA offers the same functionality as plastic, without the pollution. PHA is a biodegradable, compostable, and non-toxic alternative to traditional plastics.

How does it work?
PHA is a naturally occurring polymer, found in the cells of bacteria, that can be used as a non-toxic and biodegradable replacement to oil-based polymers. Other PHA producers use food-source/food-competing feedstocks like soy or canola, which have a land, water, and carbon footprint. Genecis uses existing food and agricultural wastes, lowering our environmental impact, valorizing waste streams, and dropping the cost of PHA production.
Our PHA is also customizable. PHA tends to be hard and brittle, making it challenging to produce PHA-based products that have flexible or amorphous characteristics. Genecis, however, can finetune the PHA comonomer ratio; PHA is a blend of butyrate and valerate, and by adjusting the percentage of each, the rigidity and flexibility of the PHA can be tuned. This allows Genecis to design PHA-based products with a wider range of applications, including: replacing single-use plastics, including packaging; clothing and textiles (with zero micro-plastic shedding); automotive interiors; medical tools and products, including sutures, grafts, and other equipment; and food contact applications.
PHA breaks down naturally in the environment without leaving behind harmful microplastics or toxic residue. Ideally, PHA products will be composted, but if they end up in a landfill or a waterway (as most products do, unfortunately), they will break down safely with no impact on the natural environment.
Our goal is to build a robust circular economy by turning organic waste into PHA, then composting PHA-based products at end-of-life so they can be upcycled into new products. The circular economy for PHA aims to create a closed-loop system where waste is minimized and resources are conserved, leading to a more sustainable and resilient economy."

Modera’s invention was very well received amongst the industry and was even awarded the prestigious Energy Top 100 award by the US Department of Energy.

To illustrate through objective facts and figures how the failure to enforce or implement environmental laws increases pollution and harms public health;
To hold federal and state agencies, as well as individual corporations, accountable for failing to enforce or comply with environmental laws; and
To help local communities obtain the protections of environmental laws.

We act as a watchdog because we have to. State and federal agencies charged with protecting the environment often are squeezed by limited resources and political interference from well-funded lobbyists hired by the industries they are required to regulate. We help level the playing field by giving communities the legal and technical resources they need to claim their rights under environmental laws.
Political influence should play no role when the government decides whether to enforce laws which keep cancer-causing benzene out of the lungs of children, for example, or deadly coal soot particles out of the bloodstreams of the elderly.
We do this by advocating for fair enforcement of environmental laws and regulations; writing and distributing reports and data; taking legal actions against big polluters and government agencies, when necessary; and by teaching communities how to participate in the public process regarding important state and federal environmental decisions."

Climate Vault,Climate Adaptation,"Chicago, IL, USA",11-50,"The Climate Vault approach is one of the simplest ways to achieve net zero. Rather than trying to estimate the carbon reductions created by planting trees or distributing clean cookstoves, we can measure exactly how much carbon pollution we’re preventing, ton by ton.
At Climate Vault, we do this by purchasing carbon permits from cap-and-trade compliance markets and vaulting them so emitters can’t use them. Because the number of permits is capped, this decreases the amount of global carbon dioxide pollution allowed by government regulators.
Our purchases are based on how much carbon you’re aiming to offset. Whether you’re looking to reduce your footprint or get all the way to net zero, we can help you reach your goals quickly.

However, many of these young students face barriers in accessing career opportunities in the environmental and green sectors. MobilizeGreen seeks to remove those hurdles. We’re a nonprofit organization focused on jumpstarting green careers for diverse students, through internships, mentoring, and youth engagement.
We address the diversity leadership gap in green STEM by connecting organizations with top-tier diverse talent, which provides students with viable pathways to meaningful careers and helps public and private sector agencies fill their talent pipelines."

When we discovered removing animals from food production would protect the planet, we didn’t ask why. We asked, Why Not. Why Not. The solution was simple (for us food-loving geniuses, that is); let’s create an algorithm that could learn how to combine an infinite combination of plants to replicate the flavor & texture of animal products - without compromising on taste, feel, or function.

TO CHANGE THE EVERYDAY

Calling all foodies and the food industry alike. We’re here to make plant-based options accessible to everyone, everywhere. Whether you’re a foodie, a chef, or an industry expert, there’s a NotCo product for you.

THE POWER OF PLANTS

ONE DELICIOUS MOUTHFUL AT A TIME
